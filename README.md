Arduino-Quadracopter
====================

This is code and schematics to control a Brushless DC Motor and ESC using an Arduino. 


You can adapt this code easily to control quadracopters, and perhaps use a JY-MCU bluetooth dongle 
to the Arduino to have bluetooth serial control of your project.


## Wiring Notes

### Connecting the ESC-To-BrushlessDCMotor
the three wires from the ESC to the Brushless DC motor can be **in any order**.

In order to reverse the default direction, **swap any two wires** from the ESC-to-BrushlessDCMotor connection.

### Common Ground

Have everything share a common ground.
